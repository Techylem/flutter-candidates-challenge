# Flutter Task for recruitment
_____________________

## Task
Create a blogger app, where anyone is able to signup with email and post a mini blog.

## Use Firebase for backend 
- Firebase Firestore as database
- Firebase Authentication for sign in and sign up [simple Email auth]
- Firebase Storage for media
[flutter firebase](https://firebase.flutter.dev/)

## Requirements:
- A user should be able to sign up
- A user should be able to login
- A user should be able to reset its password (Firebase style)
- A user should be able to create , edit and delete his blog post
- A user should be able to see blogs from everyone in REAL TIME

Blog can contain a max of 1000 words, and a photo [ optional ]

...Use [stacked architecture](https://www.filledstacks.com/) to achieve the requirements
...Using [stacked](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked) and [stacked-services](http://stacked_services) is a must

All the remaining technicalities are open ended, use your creativity to make an app ready to be published.

## UI requirements:
Design, Colors and Pages have no strict requirements, but the end product should look good and experience should be intuitive.

Use `Themedata` in root widget as much as possible to eliminate duplication of design code in widgets,

Darkmode compatibility will be a plus

## Deliverables:
Github repo
App apk
_If you are confident in you code that it will run on ios do mention it_

Note: 
1. Make sure that code is formatted according to these [guidelines](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/formatting) [use your ide flutter plugin to format code], 
2. There should not be any code Warnings.
3. Be very careful while handling streams, memory leaks etc.
4. For new Coders Donâ€™t be afraid to commit code, do as many commits as it takes.

Total size of all Dart files(in `/lib` folder) will also be considered during evaluation, so keep it compact to the best of your ability.


## Bonus:
Since flutter web is official now, try to Deploy flutter web version on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)  [design will not be included in evaluation, but every other feature should work] [flutter firebase ]

## Time Requirements:
Since it is a complete app there is no time limit, but we expect it to take ~4 day work
